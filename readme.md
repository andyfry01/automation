# Andy Fry's all in on automation station

## What
A repo to serve as a catchall for my automated tasks. Vim macros, bash scripts, Node servers, anything and everything!

## Why
I've got too much to do, and god damn it, I'm a programmer! Why not program my job? There's a lot of rote activity in any kind of work endeavor, especially programming. I should be using my tools to advance my cause and free up time for more interesting things than going through the rote steps of a task.

## How
At a reasonable interval, I will automate something. This could be the documentation of a Vim macro or the creation of a custom script for performing a task. 
I hesitate to put a number on this, will I commit and push once a day? A couple times per week? We shall see.
